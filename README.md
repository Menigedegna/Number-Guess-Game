# Number-Guess-Game
A freecodecamp challenge. To complete this project, you need to write a script that generates a random number between 1 and 1000 for users to guess. 
A number_guess database containing one table, players, was build. Code to rebuild the db is contained in **number_guess.sql**.
And a bash script **number_guess.sh** is used to run the number guessing game and edit the number_guess db.
